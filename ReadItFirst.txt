This is important note to make a OneClickMakingLifeEasierSQLObjectsBackupProgram working.
	
1. Make sure you have installed python (with pip) and git, added env variable to PATH (python and git bin and cmd).
2. Type in command prompt "pip install mssql-scripter" to install some magic.
3. Create folder under your local repository folder, where all the db backups will be stored.
4. In BackupConfigFile.txt you have to fill some credentials and database you want to backup. UserID refers to SQL username login, If you want to backup multiple databases, each of credentials set must be separated by  ###, for better readability.
5. Each line contains title. Do not delete that. Enter values after semicolon after it, without spaces.
6. Regarding paths, enter absolute folder path, without slash at the end.
7. Save Config file, lauch SQLBackupProgram.bat and pray.

How program works:
Before the backup proccess, program looking for older backups of given first database and removes it from local folder and GitHub as well. Then takes credentials set and tries to connect to given database, do a SQL object backup under "RepoBackupFolderPath" with creating separate folder underneath for each database. After succesfull backup, its doing a commit with description and pushes into GitHub.
If any problem occurs, the program will stop whole procces and force user to correct errors.
